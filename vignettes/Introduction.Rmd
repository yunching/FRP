This package contains a number of functions to analyse US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data. It is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

This package makes it easy to read, summarise and plot the above data.
